# QuizGameV3

So I may've started this in December, maybe January, but I've had to deal with Assignments, other Things I like working on, my oversized Garden, and sleeping. That is an incomplete list.<br/>
Anyway, now it's July, and I've gotten to making good progress.<br/>

<br/>(I've also decided that I can make this in a different, better way, that I'll do after I've finished this version so that I have a basis to work off for that)<br/>

# Account Details
## Login
If you dont want to create an account, then use 'stephenaccount3' as the username, and 'coloursyay' as the password, in order to access the application.
## Create Account
You can create your own account, using the Create Account Page.<br/>
You provide a Username and a Password, and then choose the Colours you'd like for your profile.<br/>
You can select Window Colours, Button Colours, Label Colours, and Entry Colours. Each has Background and Foreground Options, which must have a minimum of a 4.5:1 Colour Contrast Ratio, to be legal.<br/>
Label, Button and Entry Colours also must have a minimum of a 7:1 Colour Contrast Ratio to the Window Colour, in order to be permitted.
## Password Encryption
## Guest Accounts
These don't function yet, these will be added closer to the end of development, as I'm thinking of limiting Guest Accounts to only being able to do Quizzes.<br/>
I also consider this a Low Priority Feature.

# Questions
## Closed Questions
Typical Multiple Choice Question, as featured in previous versions.<br/>
However, now a Question can have 2-4 Answer Options, instead of the Mandated 4 of Previous Versions.
## Open Questions
Open Questions are Questions that allow the Player to enter their own Answer, which will then be deemed Correct or Incorrect if it includes Required and/or Acceptable Words (This system won't be perfect when it's written, most likely)
## Order Questions
**CURRENTLY NOT IMPLEMENTED**<br/>
Order Questions will allow the Player to order a series of Items in order to Answer the question, such as ordering Space Shuttle Orbiters by Missions Flown.
## Image Questions
**HALF IMPLEMENTED**<br/>
I've decided I'm not adding these til I'm done with all the first 2 types of questions, and til the quiz and all related things work.<br/>
It is possible to create and edit Image Questions, however they will be unusable in the Quiz, as the Toggle to include them, like with Order Questions, is disabled.<br/>
May replace these with Audio Questions so I don't have to make design modifications to the page, or just not include either all together

# Quiz System
Currently, only a Closed Question Quiz can be completed, Order Questions don't exist, and Open Questions haven't had their Logic implemented yet.<br/>
You can't review your previously placed answers.<br/>
It also doesn't save your Quizzes so you can review them at a later date.
