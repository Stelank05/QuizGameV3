# QuizGameV3

So I may've started this in December, maybe January, but I've had to deal with Assignments, other Things I like working on, my oversized Garden, and sleeping. That is an incomplete list.<br/>
Anyway, now it's July, and everything but the stuff relating to doing a Quiz and Answering Questions exists and works, mostly.<br/>
(I've also decided that I can make this in a different, better way, that I'll do after I've finished this version so that I have a basis to work off for that)<br/>

# Questions
## Closed Questions
Typical Multiple Choice Question, as featured in previous versions.<br/>
However, now a Question can have 2-4 Answer Options, instead of the Mandated 4 of Previous Versions.
## Open Questions
Open Questions are Questions that allow the Player to enter their own Answer, which will then be deemed Correct or Incorrect if it includes Required and/or Acceptable Words (This system won't be perfect when it's written, most likely)
## Order Questions
**CURRENTLY NOT IMPLEMENTED**<br/>
Order Questions will allow the Player to order a series of Items in order to Answer the question, such as ordering Space Shuttle Orbiters by Missions Flown.
## Image Questions
**HALF IMPLEMENTED**<br/>
I've decided I'm not adding these til I'm done with all the first 2 types of questions, and til the quiz and all related things work.<br/>
It is possible to create and edit Image Questions, however they will be unusable in the Quiz, as the Toggle to include them, like with Order Questions, is disabled.<br/>
May replace these with Audio Questions so I don't have to make design modifications to the page, or just not include either all together

# Quiz System
Currently, only a Closed Question Quiz can be completed, Order Questions don't exist, and Open Questions haven't had their Logic implemented yet.<br/>
You can't review your previously placed answers.<br/>
It also doesn't save your Quizzes so you can review them at a later date.
